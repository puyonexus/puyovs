Welcome to the Puyo Puyo VS 2 source code.

Puyo Puyo VS 2 was originally written by [Hernan](https://twitter.com/HernanZh/) with some contributions from other developers.

We hope that the community can benefit from this release and build a robust future for Puyo Puyo VS.

## Setup Qt

Puyo Puyo VS 2 is written in C++ using the Qt framework. You'll need some form of the Qt SDK to run it. Currently, we're using Qt 5 to compile Puyo Puyo VS 2, although Qt 4 will still work for now. (Qt 6 is not supported yet.) We're also using qmake rather than CMake for the time being.

For Linux users, it is generally advised to consult your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install `qt5-default` and `qtcreator` to get a basic Qt development environment. Exactly how to configure the Qt SDK for Linux is out of the scope of this README.

For macOS and Windows users, you have several options to get a copy of the Qt SDK. The [Qt official download page](https://www.qt.io/download) offers official installers for Qt for various platforms. Please note that these generally require you to sign up for a Qt account. We don't encourage this unless you already have a Qt account. We also have [minimal builds of the Qt SDK](https://github.com/puyonexus/qt-sdk-builder/) which are used for our automated builds; you can use these locally if you want, but they may not be compatible with Qt Creator.

(In the future, we may migrate off of Qt or use Qt via vcpkg instead.)

## Building

Once you have a Qt SDK setup, you can build a copy of Puyo VS by building the Client target.

If you prefer the terminal, you can setup a quick build like so:

```sh
# Set up build directory outside of the source code
mkdir ../build && cd ../build

# Run CMake to configure a build for this build dir. You can also specify debug.
cmake ../puyovs

# Run make. Use higher values for parallel if you have a lot of cores.
#
# WARNING: On Windows you may need to add --config Release or --config RelWithDebInfo
#          if your Qt SDK build is only release mode, like the ones from qt-sdk-builder.
#          This is because the MSVC CRT linking may conflict.
cmake --build . --parallel 4

# Assuming all is well, you can run your new shiny PuyoVS executable.
./Client/PuyoVS

# On macOS, you'll need to do something like
# $ open ./Client/PuyoVS.app
# And on Windows, something like
# $ .\Client\Release\PuyoVS.exe

# TODO: Currently the build will not find its own assets.
# You can copy the contents of the Test folder next to the binary.
# In the case of macOS, copy it into the app bundle next to the PuyoVS executable.
# This should be resolved in the future. Please be patient :)
```

**Want code completion?** You can use any IDE with CMake support, like Qt Creator, Visual Studio, or CLion. In addition, on UNIX-like platforms, you can [generate a `compile_commands.json` database](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html) and use it with clangd.
